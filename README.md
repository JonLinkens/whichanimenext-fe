# whichanimenext?

The frontend of an anime recommendation service. Search an anime to be given 5 anime that are most similar. Built using React CRA with Tailwind CSS.

Search bar uses react-select and is linked to an API JSON response.

The recommendations aren't actually that good as this project was used for learning - if you want a proper recommendation service I would suggest using [AniBrain](https://anibrain.ai/recommender/anime).

If you want to learn more about the datasets and model used, please visit the backend API repository found [here](https://github.com/JonLinkens/whichanimenext-api).

### .env variables:

`REACT_APP_API_URL` pointing to the API url (with no trailing forward slash)
